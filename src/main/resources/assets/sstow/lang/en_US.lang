guide.book.journal.title=Petrified Studies, A Forest Gone
guide.book.journal.message=Welcome Reader, to the strangest of my adventures as a Biologist, I make note that it is all real indeed
guide.book.journal.name=Dr. Richland's Journal
guide.book.journal.notes=Notes
guide.book.journal.note1=Note 1
guide.book.journal.note1.page01=I am Dr. Richland, Plant Biologist for the area. I’m writing these reports to take note of events that have unfolded in the last few days. First, there have been rumours of a forest being strange, supernatural even. Legends from nearby villages told the story of a strange portal to another world hidden away. Simple fairy tales I’m sure, I’ll be meeting with some locals who contacted me asking for help understanding what has happened there. A 

guide.book.journal.note1.page02=strange phenomena occurred it seems, the forest suddenly underwent mass petrification, such a mystery is worth my time indeed, if this turns out to be a ruse I’ll be sorely upset. Regardless, I’m packing my things and heading out on horseback, I shall continue with the next note when I’ve arrived.

guide.book.journal.note2=Note 2
guide.book.journal.note2.page01=I, Doctor Richland, have arrived, it has been a few hours and I’ve had time to process everything as I write at this poorly crafted wooden desk. This place is rife with diseases the rest of the world cured, most of the locals in town distrust me and some even think I may upset their gods. I must be careful if I am to not arouse a mob of them after my head. Anyway, I arrived and was greeted by a young man, the village chieftain’s son, Akawo, he

guide.book.journal.note2.page02=seemed rather jubilant to meet me. It seems as the son of the chieftain he was allowed to see things from the outside world and came across my studies. Quite the fan, that one. He was the one to send the requisition of help and I obliged, he seems off though, I can’t tell what it is about him. Regardless, the village sits on the edge of the forest, so even as I came into town via horseback, I saw just how serious this problem was. Hundreds upon 

guide.book.journal.note2.page03=hundreds of trees, it was like a plague, they were all petrified, leaves dead and frozen in time on the once lively wood. This is indeed strange, unlike anything I’ve ever seen before, I fear I won’t be able to do anything and when I told Akawo this in private he assured me that any help I could provide would be grand. Maybe even life saving. I didn’t know what he meant until he told me, without the trees one half of their source of food, the 

guide.book.journal.note2.page04=animals that lived in the forest, are leaving it or dying from a lack of food. It’s an entire ecosystem that’s failing and I don’t understand, people in the village are conserving their food and some haven’t eaten much more than a loaf of bread in the last two days. I have to do something, I will continue writing my findings as they come up.

guide.book.journal.note3=Note 3
guide.book.journal.note3.page01=It has been a few days since I’ve arrived and written in this blasted thing, well, better late than never. Food has been sparse in the village and yet with the customs I have not gone hungry as their guest, it saddens me to see such distrust even now with most of the village but unavoidable. My research so far has done nothing to discover the problem so I am forced to go further in. After a heated conversation with the chieftain I found that

guide.book.journal.note3.page02=going farther than what I have gone in is a rather faux pau outside of the chieftain and son. I need to find a way to get out of the village and into the forest without them knowing, it’ll be hard to do but...ugh, maybe if I had an inside source.
